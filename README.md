# Xamarin-Forms-Map-Demo
This is an example of the implementation of Xamarin.Forms.Maps and the James Montemagno Geolocator Plugin. 
The code is based on the official documentationhttps://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/user-interface/map/

To make it works you need to create an API Key for the Google Maps API as is shown in this site https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/platform_features/maps_and_location/maps/obtaining_a_google_maps_api_key/
